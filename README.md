processing app to display a bunch of peace signs.

## Background

When my daughter was about 10 I wanted to show her how to program.  At
the time she was really into fashion (like making dresses for her Barbie
dolls and peace signs. I told her that knowing how to program could help
her design clothes and that she could make all the peace signs she
wanted.  She was dubious of my claim but the promise of unending peace
signs was enough. We sat down down and I asked her what she wante to
see. She was very good at communicating a vision. So first we drew a
peace sign (in this version I just found an svg and modify it but in the
original we drew all the elements). Once we had the prototype I showed
how we could make it bigger or smaller, how to translate it, and how to
rotate it.  Then we talked about what colors she wanted to see.

It took most of an afternoon and it proved to her that programming was a
complete waste of time.

This isn't exactly the same code as before. In the original I added
Perlin noise to the peace signs to make them a little more "groovy."
